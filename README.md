👋 Hi, I’m Andrés Ingelmo. I hold an MBA in International Maangement from the ICEX-CECO and a Bachelor Degree in Economics from the University of Salamanca. In 2021, after living in multiple countries and having worked in a wide variety of fields, I decided to pursue the career I always wanted: data analytics. During my free time I love to play videogames and do multiple sports.

In my GitHub, I try to show my personal achievements regarding data analytics and code. I´m still learning so my first projects don´t have anything to do with my newest one. I love to learn and my life is driven by the continuous improvement. Hope you can see my progress checking out my profile!
