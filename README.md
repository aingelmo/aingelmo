ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @aingelmo. I hold an MBA in International Maangement from the ICEX-CECO and a Bachelor Degree in Economics from the University of Salamanca. In 2021, after living in multiple countries and having worked in a wide variety of fields, I decided to pursue the career I always wanted: data analytics. During my free time I love to play videogames and do multiple sports.
